# Peering Into the Shadows: Linux Rootkits From Red and Blue Perspectives

Rootkits have been around for decades, quietly evolving alongside the operating systems they target. On Linux, theyâ€™ve taken multiple formsâ€”each leveraging different layers of the stack to hide processes, steal credentials, or maintain persistence. For defenders, understanding how these rootkits work isnâ€™t just academic; itâ€™s the first step in spotting them in the wild.

This post breaks down three major classes of Linux rootkits:

- **Userspace rootkits (LD_PRELOAD, library hijacking)**
- **Kernel rootkits (loadable kernel modules)**
- **eBPF rootkits (a newer and stealthier frontier)**

Weâ€™ll explore how each is built and deployed, and what both red teamers (attackers) and blue teamers (defenders) should know.

## Userspace Rootkits (LD_PRELOAD & Library Replacement)

#TODO: also include the overwriting binaries part (put code example for that if tim)
#TODO: also include the ptrace?? stuff - idk what it was called. Try to include lots of varieties of method (atleast for article)

**ðŸ”´ Red Team View**
LD_PRELOAD is the low-hanging fruit of rootkits. By preloading a malicious shared library before legitimate ones, attackers can hook libc functions like `open`, `read`, or `getdents`. With this, they can hide files, filter processes from `ps`, or even backdoor authentication routines.

Advantages:

- Simple to write (a few lines of C can hook core syscalls).
- Doesnâ€™t require root privileges in some cases.
- Easy persistence via `~/.bashrc`, `/etc/ld.so.preload`.

**ðŸ”µ Blue Team View**
Detection strategies:

- Check `/etc/ld.so.preload` for unexpected entries.
- Run tools like `ldd` or `readelf` on suspicious binaries.
- Use integrity checkers (Tripwire, AIDE) to spot library tampering.

Limitations for attackers: LD_PRELOAD is fragile. Static binaries and containers may ignore it, and defenders can easily detect tampered libraries if they know where to look.

## Kernel Rootkits (Loadable Kernel Modules)

**ðŸ”´ Red Team View**
Kernel modules are the classic heavy-hitters. By inserting malicious code into the kernel, attackers can hook syscalls, hide processes, patch credentials, and bypass security modules. Unlike LD_PRELOAD, kernel rootkits operate below the visibility of userspace tools, making them far more stealthy.

Techniques:

- Syscall table hooking (`sys_call_table`).
- Direct kernel object manipulation (DKOM) to unlink processes.
- Netfilter hooks to hide backdoor traffic.

**ðŸ”µ Blue Team View**
Defenders have several angles:

- Compare `/proc/modules` vs. `lsmod` outputs for hidden modules.
- Check kernel integrity with LKRG (Linux Kernel Runtime Guard).
- Baseline kernel memory with forensic tools like Volatility.

The challenge: once an attacker is in kernel space, theyâ€™re on nearly equal footing with the OS itself. Traditional userspace monitoring often canâ€™t see this deep.

## eBPF Rootkits (The Modern Stealth Layer)

**ðŸ”´ Red Team View**
eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) was designed for observability and performance monitoringâ€”but attackers love it for the same reasons. An eBPF program can hook into kernel functions dynamically without loading a traditional module, bypassing some monitoring.

Rootkit potential:

- Hide network connections by filtering them out in eBPF maps.
- Hook process events invisibly.
- Persist stealthily, since eBPF programs donâ€™t always appear as modules.

**ðŸ”µ Blue Team View**
Detection here is still maturing. Strategies include:

- Enumerate loaded eBPF programs (`bpftool prog show`).
- Lock down unprivileged eBPF usage (newer kernels restrict this).
- Watch for suspicious eBPF syscalls (`bpf()`) in audit logs.

eBPF rootkits are a rising threat because they blend in with legitimate observability tooling, making them perfect for living-off-the-land attacks.

## Red Team vs. Blue Team: A Comparative Lens

| Rootkit Type      | Red Team Advantages                                              | Blue Team Detection Strategies                             | Stealth Level        |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **LD_PRELOAD**    | Easy to build, works in userland, no kernel interaction required | Check `/etc/ld.so.preload`, library integrity monitoring   | Low                  |
| **Kernel Module** | Deep control, syscall hooking, process/file hiding               | LKRG, Volatility, kernel integrity checks                  | High                 |
| **eBPF**          | Modern, stealthy, blends with observability tools                | `bpftool`, audit syscall usage, restrict unprivileged eBPF | Medium-High (rising) |
